# Board-Game-Framework

The Board Game Centre System is a framework that is used to add new board games to the system and play them. The System will maintain the records of the games played by the user and also give them the ability to share and analyze the games with their friends. Due to the design patterns and the object-oriented principles, it becomes easy to extend and add new games.
